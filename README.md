# practice_01_fib
First in a "practice" series of repositories. In these repos will be included code created personally to practice programming, computer science, and software creation.

## Goals
1. Create functions to implement:
   - a recursive process
   - an iterative process
   - a memoization process
2. Compare each process by timing their performance
3. Generate a .csv data-set for analysis in R
4. Accomplish #1-3 in the following programming languages:
   - Python
   - Javascript
   - C / C++
   - shell
5. Exercise good comment, note-keeping, and documentation practices
6. Exercise other good coding practices such as:
   - Code minimization
   - Function management
   - Inheritance management
   - Commit practices
   - Case / error-handling
7. Perform thorough statistical analysis of generated dataset in R

## Discovered pre-requisites / co-requisites:

1. Decorator functions in python
